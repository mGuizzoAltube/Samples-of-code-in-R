Here you can find some samples of my R codes.

The sample code titled "Big Data" corresponds to the [final assignment stored in the Writing samples folder](https://github.com/mGuizzoAltube/Writing-samples/blob/main/Big%20Data%20Final%20Assignment%20-%20MGA.pdf). The code fragment in this folder is of my complete authorship.

The sample code titled "Time Series" corresponds to the final exam of the time series course at UdeSA.
